Set up a https://ifttt.com/ account

Set up a IFTT everytime that someone posts on a subreddit like https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/ IFTT will post it onto your google docs

After that you will have every post to that subredit that happened after in the google doc. 

After that i use this python code to use named entity recognition and other NLP tools to decode redit description to simple who what where parts that i can translate into SQL code that i can post straight into histolines.com
